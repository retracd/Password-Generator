# Password-Generator
A simple password generator with a terrible looking GUI, easy to fix though for practical use.


If you knww anything about the Python library tkinter, then you'd know it is very easy to change the colors, as simple as copying and pasting hex color values. There isnt much to explain as 7/8s of the code is the GUI where the other 1/8 is the actual function to generate the password. It is all pretty simple and as a small project took me about 2 hours.
